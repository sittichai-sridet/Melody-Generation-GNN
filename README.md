# Melody-Generation-GNN
This work is part of a Deep Learning project conducted by Thanisorn Carpholdee, Sittichai Sridet and Nichanan Phetkong

## Introduction
We define melody as a collection of tones of different frequencies. So, the Automatic Melody Generation is a process of composing a short piece of music with minimum human intervention
Melody Generation lets AI create a new melody by itself with deep learning techniques #student work #DeepLearning project

This work uses a generative model like LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) to train with Nottingham Music Database data.

In addition to sitting clean, the information is ready for use. And experimenting with creating melody both with cord and without cord,
 also adding a roulette wheel technique to replace what the model says. It will pick a dull note accordingly, 
then switch to using the roulette wheel to add randomness to the next note. 
(Based on our team's experience with LSTM homework that sometimes LSTM repeats the next gen.)
